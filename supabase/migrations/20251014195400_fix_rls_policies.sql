  # Fix RLS Policies for Custom Auth

  ## Changes
  This migration fixes Row Level Security policies to work with custom authentication
  instead of Supabase Auth. Since we're not using `auth.uid()`, we need to allow
  public access with appropriate restrictions.

  ## Security Approach
  - Allow public read access for users to view their own data
  - Allow public insert for user creation (signup)
  - Allow public update for users to update their own profile
  - Pool and member operations are allowed for authenticated users
  - Service role maintains full access for backend operations

  ## Important Notes
  This is a simplified auth model for development. For production, you should:
  1. Implement proper Supabase Auth or use service role keys on backend
  2. Add additional validation layers
  3. Consider implementing API endpoints for sensitive operations
